The objective of this project was to explore the number of posts in the job market and it's requirements(skills) within the industry. More particularly within the company Egyptian tech companies. Also, I wanted to gain more knowledge and experience in web-scraping.

I wrote a python scripts, namely "main.py" and to responsibly scrape the  website "https://www.wuzzuf.net". And i searched about jobs related to Python posts. Used beautifulsoup4 package and lxml package. "main.py" is code in which it gathers informations about the job requirements such as (Job title/ Company name/ Location/ Skills/ Salary/ Post date), and generate a csv file containing these informations.


In files you'll find a 'jobs_scrapping.csv' file, containing a preview of the results got from the script.

This project is based on web scraping technologie using python 3.8.0. To work on this project you need to install:


===> bs4 module (pip/ pip3 install lxml).

===> requests module (pip/ pip3 install requests).


Also, you need csv module to create sheets file and itertools module to unpack some lists.
